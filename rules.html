        <h1>Rock, Paper, Scissors Game Rules</h1>
        <h2>Gameplay:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The game is played between two players: the user and the computer (or two human players, depending on your implementation).</li>
            <li>Each player chooses one of three options: <strong>Rock</strong>, <strong>Paper</strong>, or <strong>Scissors</strong>.</li>
            <li>The choices are made simultaneously, and the winner is determined based on the following rules.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Winning Conditions:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rock beats Scissors:</strong> Rock crushes Scissors.</li>
            <li><strong>Scissors beat Paper:</strong> Scissors cut Paper.</li>
            <li><strong>Paper beats Rock:</strong> Paper covers Rock.</li>
            <li>If both players choose the same option (Rock vs. Rock, Paper vs. Paper, or Scissors vs. Scissors), it results in a <strong>tie</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Scoring:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The winner of each round earns 1 point.</li>
            <li>The game can be played as a single round or best of three, five, or any other number of rounds.</li>
            <li>At the end of all rounds, the player with the most points is the winner.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Game Flow:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Players select their choice (e.g., by clicking a button).</li>
            <li>The computer randomly selects its choice if playing against a computer.</li>
            <li>The result is displayed on the screen (e.g., “You Win!”, “You Lose!”, “It’s a Tie!”).</li>
            <li>Scores are updated accordingly.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Restarting the Game:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>After the end of a round or a set of rounds, players can choose to restart the game to play again.</li>
        </ul>
